 Matsutake Suitability Map

This map was created to show areas where Western Pine Matsutake (Tricholoma Murrillianum) are likely to occur based on publicly available data sources. Data used in the map include dominant soil type, dominant tree species, tree height and iNaturalist locations of Allotropa virgata(a known symbiont). 

Data limitations: 
  Data coverage- The current extent of the modeled area is the east slopes of the Cascades including the Loomis State forest area. Farther east such as Coville National Forest have not been included. Soil data for Olympic National Park was not available as well as for Indian Reservations such as Yakima and Quinault.
